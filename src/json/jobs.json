A ski and snowboard technician can be based either in the UK, or as is more likely, in a repair centre at an overseas ski resort. The work is seasonal in the respect that the European ski season runs from November to late April, meaning that those working overseas will normally return to the UK for the off-season. These “dead busy and dead” spells have an equal impact on UK workers, as there is much less work during the summer months. The technician will be expected to work on both skis and snowboards, as the basic repair and servicing knowledge is common to both, and there is not normally enough work to specialise in one or the other. The technician will fix damage to the equipment, mount bindings, complete base waxing and organise general tuning of the customer’s winter sports kit. At non-busy times, the technician will often be expected to serve on the retail or customer service counters of the ski outlet.",
